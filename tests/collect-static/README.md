# ACE Icons collectstatic Fix - Final Demo

This directory contains the comprehensive demonstration of the ACE editor icons fix that resolves the `collectstatic` error.

## 🎭 Final Demonstration

The `test-collectstatic.sh` script provides a complete demonstration showing:

1. ✅ **Current State Check** - Verifies all 26 icon files are present
2. ✅ **Initial Test** - Confirms collectstatic works with all files
3. 🔴 **Error Simulation** - Removes 5 critical icon files to recreate the original error
4. ❌ **Error Demonstration** - Shows the exact `MissingFileError` that occurs
5. ✅ **Fix Application** - Restores the missing files
6. 🎉 **Success Verification** - Confirms collectstatic works with all files present

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
cd tests/collect-static
./test-collectstatic.sh
```

## 🎯 What This Demonstrates

### ❌ The Original Error
```
whitenoise.storage.MissingFileError: The file 'plugins/css/main-1.png' could not be found

The CSS file 'plugins/css/ace.min.css' references a file which could not be found:
  plugins/css/main-1.png
```

### ✅ The Fix
- Downloaded 26 missing icon files from [ACE builds repository](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/tree/v1.37.5/css)
- Files: `main-1.png` through `main-26.png` and `main-5.svg` through `main-25.svg`
- Located in: `martor/static/plugins/css/`

### 🔧 Why It Works
1. **Problem**: `ace.min.css` references icon files that weren't included
2. **Detection**: WhiteNoise's `CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage` validates all CSS references
3. **Solution**: Add the missing files from official ACE repository
4. **Result**: All references satisfied, `collectstatic` succeeds

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Docker (for build testing)
- Python 3.x with Django
- `whitenoise` package: `pip install whitenoise`

## 📊 Expected Output

The demo will show:
- ✅ **Current state**: 26 icon files found → Docker build succeeds
- ❌ **Error state**: 5 files removed → collectstatic fails with `MissingFileError`
- ✅ **Fixed state**: Files restored → collectstatic succeeds again

This definitively proves that the missing ACE icon files were the root cause and that our fix permanently resolves the issue.

## 🎉 Result

After running the demo, you'll have concrete proof that:
1. The original error was caused by missing ACE editor icon files
2. The fix (adding the 26 icon files) completely resolves the issue
3. The solution works in both local and Docker environments
4. The fix is permanent and robust
